        <p>
          I have worked in multiple areas of communication, including various
          science communication spaces, such as journals and conferences, in
          addition to knowing first-hand the process of research and production
          of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about learning, and I am passionate about facilitating
          access to knowledge for others. I always try to learn and understand
          new and complex topics and techniques, and I enjoy the challenge of
          explaining and applying them in my immediate environment and my
          personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a person who constantly sets goals, considers feasible scenarios,
          make plans, and is not satisfied until they are met. I am well known
          as someone who raises his hand whenever something new needs to be
          started and nobody knows where to start, and there is nothing more
          personally gratifying than seeing my efforts materialize.
